# Virtual-reality

This Project was developed for CodeDesign Hackathon, where my idea was making virtual photo browsing application.<br> 
This code is Image Service API where it could be used to get image from the web. It delegates its request to various image sites and downloads the image file in your local directory.
This was used with Xbox Kinect for setting up a queue and using hand gesture to zoom -in/out and also selcting image from the queue .

In Short : This is what i wanted to create .<br>
